JRUBY plugin modules.

Every module under this directly is automatically loaded into the JRuby
process. The modules define instance methods of the JRubyDaemon class,
which can then be invoked over DRb.

These modules should have no inter-dependencies (i.e. they do should not
require() each other). Shared code should be in plugins/shared. All of these
modules will be loaded automatically, so their presence at runtime can be
assumed (i.e. if one is loaded, they all are).
